\title{Calculate G and C content of nucleotide sequences}
\usage{
GC(ntseq, ambiguous = FALSE, totalnt = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{ntseq}{Sequence (5' to 3') of one strand of the nucleic acid duplex as string or vector of characters.}

\item{ambiguous}{Ambiguous bases are taken into account to compute the G and C content when ambiguous is TRUE.}

\item{totalnt}{Sum of 'G' and 'C' bases divided by the length of the sequence when totalnt is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Content of G and C(range from 0 to 100%)
}
\description{
Calculate G and C content of nucleotide sequences. The number of G and C in sequence is divided by length of sequence(when totalnt is TRUE) or the number of all A,T,C,G and ambiguous base.
}
