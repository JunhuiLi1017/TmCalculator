\title{Filter and replace invalid bases in nucleotide sequences}
\usage{
filter_seq(seq_list, method)
}
\arguments{
\item{seq_list}{Input sequence in 5' to 3' direction. Must be provided as:
- A list of sequences with attributes (name and Tm)}

\item{method}{Method to determine valid bases:

TM_Wallace: Valid bases are "A","B","C","D","G","H","I","K","M","N","R","S","T","V","W" and "Y"

TM_GC: Valid bases are "A","B","C","D","G","H","I","K","M","N","R","S","T","V","W", "X" and "Y"

TM_NN: Valid bases are "A","C","G","I" and "T"}
}
\value{
Returns a list of sequences with the same structure as input, where invalid bases are replaced with "."
}
\description{
This function processes nucleotide sequences by converting characters to uppercase and replacing invalid bases with "." 
based on the specified method. The function preserves the sequence length and attributes (name and Tm) of each sequence.
